# Cursor Rules for Tags Project

## Language and Communication
- Always respond in Hebrew (RTL)
- Code, file paths, and commands in English (LTR)
- Keep responses concise unless detailed explanation is requested

## Workflow
- Describe what you're about to change before making changes
- Ask for explicit approval before proceeding
- Use "approve", "continue", or "yes" for approval
- Prefer simplicity and safety over complex solutions

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow project ESLint rules
- Write readable and documented code

## Git Practices
