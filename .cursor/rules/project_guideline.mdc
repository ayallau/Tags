## Design Reference
- **Images are under**: apps/web/public/DesignReference/*
- Attach: <Include appropriate image from apps/web/public/DesignReference>
- Use the image strictly as visual inspiration (layout/spacing/feel), do NOT copy pixel-perfect.

## Design Guardrails — MUST FOLLOW
- **Tech Stack**: React + TypeScript + Vite, Tailwind + shadcn/ui, Radix primitives, Framer Motion (micro-animations only), React Router.
- **Dark Mode**: Theme system with class="dark" (media fallback), color palettes through Tailwind tokens only.
- **Spacing & Grid**: 4/8pt scale, modern grid/flex, clear typographic headings.
- **Accessibility**: AA contrast, visible focus, aria-* where needed, keyboard trap=false.
- **Responsiveness**: Mobile-first, standard Tailwind breakpoints.
- **Motion**: Short and subtle; reduce/disable when prefers-reduced-motion.
- **Performance**: Lazy loading (lazy routes), Skeletons for all loading screens, no layout shift.
- **shadcn/ui**: Use existing components; extend only when required.

## Repository Rules — MUST FOLLOW
- **Load and follow**: .cursor\rules\project_guideline.mdc
- **Environment Files**: No creation/update of .env files. If example needed — create .env.example only.
- **Module System**: Maintain ESM + TS "NodeNext". Do not change base tsconfig without approval.
- **Checkpoints**: Before major changes: perform commit checkpoint.
- **Code Language**: All code, comments, strings, and UI text must be in English only, unless otherwise specified or required by the user.

## Task Guidelines
- Describe briefly what you are about to change.
- Execute only the current step. Do not jump to the next stage.
- Provide Acceptance Criteria + brief manual tests.
- build the code in the browser and test it.

## Deliverables
- List of files to be created/modified.
- Manual tests and execution instructions.

## Approval Process
- If everything is correct, respond with "approve". Wait before writing to disk.
